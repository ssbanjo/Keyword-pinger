This bot will ping a role or user on a previous specified channel if all the positive keywords are found on the embed contents and no negative keywords are found following a **case insensitive** algorithm.

# Installation
- Make sure to have all indent privileges enabled for your bot.
- Give the bot admin or high permissions on your server so it can tag any role, read messages and see all channels.
- Move the bot role above any roles you or your users might want to tag.
- You must fill the constants.py file with appropriate values before running the bot.

# Instructions
- A generic ping will be added if the optional camp `target_role` is used, else the ping will be linked to the user sending the command.
